Hi, I'm Sean. I create web apps with Ruby on Rails. I have a love for learning and building new things.

My most cherished accomplishment in the web technology space has been creating [slashrocket](https://slashrocket.io), a community that brings developers together to learn and discuss web development.

When I'm not on my computer I'm either exploring Houston and its many eateries with my family, yelling at my [favorite](//texassports.com/?path=football) [sports](//astros.com) [teams](//rockets.com), or enjoying a new [book](//read.seanosaur.com), movie, or podcast.

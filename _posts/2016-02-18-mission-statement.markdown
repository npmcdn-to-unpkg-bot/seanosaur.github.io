## Write more. Read more. Learn more.

### _Write more._

Starting today. I'll write about anything and everything, whenever I get a chance. I download lots of apps, and I'll write about each one. I do some programming stuff. That goes here, too.

### _Read more._

Whether it's an audiobook or a basic paperback, I need to read more. I log my reading [over here](http://read.seanosaur.com).

### _Learn more._

I've been learning web development for over a year now. Lots to learn, still. Follow my progress on [GitHub](http://github.com/seanosaur) or join me in my [slashrocket](http://slashrocket.io) Slack community!

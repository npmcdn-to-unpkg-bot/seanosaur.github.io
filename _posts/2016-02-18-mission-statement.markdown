**Write more.**

Starting today. I'll write about anything and everything, whenever I get a chance. I download lots of apps, and I'll write about each one. I do some programming stuff. That goes here, too.

**Read more.**

Whether it's an audiobook or a basic paperback, I need to read more. I log my reading [over here](read.seanosaur.com).

**Learn more.**

I've been learning web development for over a year now. Lots to learn, still. Follow my progress on [GitHub](github.com/seanosaur) or join me in my [slashrocket](slashrocket.io) Slack community!

<p>Hi, I'm Sean. I create web apps with Ruby on Rails. I have a love for learning and building new things.</p>

<p>My most cherished accomplishment in the web technology space has been creating <a href="https://slashrocket.io">slashrocket</a>, a community that brings developers together to learn and discuss web development.</p>

<p>When I'm not on my computer I'm either exploring Houston and its many eateries with my family, yelling at my favorite sports teams, or enjoying a new book, movie, or podcast.</p>
